            <p>The app offers non-coding Xerte users the opportunity to produce a theme without having to learn HTML and CSS. The user's edits appear in real-time via a Xerte project preview window.</p>
            
            <p>The web app is accessible on desktop, tablet and smartphones.</p>
            
            <p>Please note that XhibitApp is still a work-in-progress. A preview version was launched at the Xerte Conference on 14th April 2016 in Nottingham, UK, and we continue to make adjustments and improvements.</p>
