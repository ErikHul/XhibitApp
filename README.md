## What is XhibitApp?

XhibitApp is a supporting project for [Xerte](www.xerte.org.uk), the free, open source e-learning content creation tool.

This web app offers Xerte users the opportunity to produce a theme without having to learn HTML and CSS. The user's edits appear in real-time via a Xerte project preview window.

The web app is accessible on desktop, tablet and smartphones.

Please note that XhibitApp is still a work-in-progress. A preview version was launched at the Xerte Conference on 14th April 2016 in Nottingham, UK, and we continue to make adjustments and improvements.

## How do I get started?

It's easy - Visit the [XhibitApp website](http://www.xhibitapp.com/) to create your Xerte theme.

Feel free to browse or contribute to the source code on GitHub.
